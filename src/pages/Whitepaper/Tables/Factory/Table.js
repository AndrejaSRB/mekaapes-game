          Robo Oogas can only leave the factory when they have at least 6,000
          $OG claimable. Leaving the factory is dangerous and it can happen that
          the Robo Oogas are attacked by evil Space Droids. Thereâ€™s a 50% risk
          that their accumulated $OG gets stolen. All $OG that gets stolen is
          then retrieved by MekaApes which they keep for their service.
